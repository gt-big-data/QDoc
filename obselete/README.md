# What is this?

This folder contains a bunch of files that were probably useful at one point in time.

This includes things like:

* Data files that originally populated the DB with RSS feeds
* Scripts for doing maintenance work on the DB (assume they are all horribly broken)
* `func.py` might still work but I can't figure out what it's used for (it was probably "borrowed" from the entities team)
