From its awkward beginnings to an international phenomenon with 1.4 billion users, here's a look at the many faces of Facebook.\nHide Caption\n 1 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n \u2013 \nIt was first known as \"Thefacebook\" when it launched at Harvard University as a way for students to connect. The social-networking site spread to Columbia, Stanford and Yale universities the following month, and the Facebook Wall made its debut in September. By December, Thefacebook had nearly 1 million users.\nHide Caption\n 2 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n2005: Students spread the word\n \u2013 \nThe site grew beyond the Ivy League to include more than 800 colleges and universities by May 2005, and its official name changed from Thefacebook to just Facebook that August. Facebook began allowing high school students to join in September.\nHide Caption\n 3 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n2006: Meet the News Feed\n \u2013 \nBy 2006, anyone 13 and up was allowed to join Facebook. That same year Facebook introduced the News Feed, which highlighted  new updates and photos within your social networks. As they would after almost every major change, Facebook users revolted, starting a petition to change Facebook back. One petitioner said, \"I don't need to know everything about EVERYONE.\" \nHide Caption\n 4 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n2007: Another new design\n \u2013 \nFacebook updated its site design in April 2007, moving friends, networks and the inbox to the top of each page and photos, notes, groups and events to a bar on the left. Facebook Platform launched in May, which allowed for developers to create third-party apps. (Another backlash erupted when those apps started requesting personal information.) Later that year, Facebook introduced ads, which convinced some users the site was going the way of MySpace. \nHide Caption\n 5 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n2008: New profile pages\n \u2013 \nFacebook profile pages were redesigned in 2008 to add five main tabs: Feed, Wall, Info, Photos and Boxes. The new design was, as usual, met with negative comments from users resistant to change. Facebook also debuted its Chat feature that year, allowing real-time instant messaging. \nHide Caption\n 6 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n2009: The 'Like' button\n \u2013 \nThe \"Like\" button was introduced on Facebook in 2009, letting users show appreciation for clever status updates or pictures of their friends' cats getting into shenanigans. Cynical users demanded a \"Dislike\" button. Facebook also launched Pages to let fans follow celebrities, sports teams or causes.\nHide Caption\n 7 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n2010: Growing privacy concerns\n \u2013 \nFacebook introduced instant personalization, which gave partner  websites information about users so they could personalize your experience. Advocacy groups like the ACLU reacted negatively to the new feature, saying users should have to opt in instead of getting the setting by default. Under pressure, Zuckerberg tweaked Facebook's settings to give users greater control over privacy.\nHide Caption\n 8 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n2010: Facebook adds 'check-ins'\n \u2013 \nTaking a cue from apps like Foursquare (and rival Gowalla, which it eventually bought in 2011), Facebook launched Places, which allowed mobile users to check in at their locations. The most \"checked-in\" spot? Disneyland.\nHide Caption\n 9 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n2011: Photos, photos everywhere\n \u2013 \nBy February 2011, Facebook had become the Web's largest host of photographs. Over its decade, users have uploaded more than 250 billion photos to the site. And by the end of the year, it began scrapping users' Walls in favor of another layout change. Fast forward to 2012 ...\nHide Caption\n 10 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n \u2013 \nMobile users who want to message friends can do so using the Messenger app, introduced in 2011.\nHide Caption\n 11 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n2012: Hello, Timeline\n \u2013 \nIn the spring of 2012, Facebook forced all users to convert to its Timeline profile layout, which arranged updates in chronological order, searchable by year. \nHide Caption\n 12 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n2013: Going mobile\n \u2013 \nBy late 2013, Facebook reported that 945 million of its 1.2 billion users were visiting via a smartphone or tablet. After years as a Web-first product, Facebook began putting a new emphasis on mobile tools, growth and revenue. \nHide Caption\n 13 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n \u2013 \nHide Caption\n 14 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n2013: Hashtags\n \u2013 \nHide Caption\n 15 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\n2015: Embedded Facebook videos\n \u2013 \nFacebook began competing with YouTube by allowing users to upload videos directly to the social network. In 2015, they also began allowing users to easily embed Facebook videos in other platforms.\nHide Caption\n 16 of 17\n17 photos:\nFacebook's biggest changes\nFacebook published this map in 2013 that shows its global reach. The lighter a country or region, the higher its concentration of Facebook users (note the black hole of China). But some believe the social network has reached a saturation point and is poised for a decline, especially among fickle younger users.\nHide Caption\n 17 of 17\nStory highlights\nMark Zuckerberg of Facebook finally sees the value of having a \"dislike\" button \nAndre Spicer: This is welcoming news since many people are drilled to think only positive \nAndre Spicer is a professor of organizational behavior at Cass Business School, City University London. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. \n (CNN)\nWe have all had the experience of being gagged by the \"like\" button on Facebook. As we scroll through our news feed, we sometimes come across stories that trigger loathing, sadness or even rage. But all we have is a like button. Sure, we can write a long message in the comment field. But there is no button to instantly express negative emotions. \nAndre Spicer\nThat is about to change. Facebook has announced it will create a \"dislike button.\" Only last year, Mark Zuckerberg said, \"Some people have asked for a dislike button because they want to be able to say 'that thing isn't good,' and we're not going to do that ... I don't think that's socially very valuable, or great for the community.\"\nNow, Zuckerberg has admitted that \"not every moment is good\" and perhaps a dislike button isn't such a bad idea after all.\nZuckerberg may have changed his mind, but many other people have not. Some think the \ndislike button\naggressive behavior online\n. But the biggest worry is the button will \"\nactively foster negativity\nIt seems we have become so fragile that any sign of negativity -- even a simple thumbs down on a social media website -- is something that must be avoided at all costs. All we want is a constant stream of thumbs up. The slightest sign someone might disagree with us is enough to send us into an emotional tailspin.  \nOne of the most insidious ideas of our time is positive thinking. It's drilled into many of us: think positive, don't think negative. It's no wonder people find the prospect of the dislike button so worrisome.  \nBeing positive certainly comes with benefits. But research is starting to reveal that all this \nupbeat thinking has some big downsides\n. When we are unable to express negative feelings, many human emotions become off limits. We avoid taking a realistic look at problems, which means we overlook risks and do stupid things. Those who don't feel on top of the world start to think there is something seriously wrong with them. Those in an upbeat mood tend to be more selfish and feel more socially disconnected. What is even more surprising is that people told to think positively often end up feeling worse.\nAs we start to recognize the limits of always looking on the bright side, negative thinking is making a comeback. \nIt's not just Facebook that will allow you to dislike things. Some companies have started to support their employees in pointing out problems. One particularly interesting method that firms are using to avoid the mistakes made by our bias toward positive thinking is the \"\npre-mortem\nLiving with the thumbs down will be tough. We may get upset, be disturbed and sometimes feel gloomy. Excessive negativity can easily become bullying. But having a space to share our negative feelings every now and then can help us own up to the many problems that we face, and hopefully, deal with them in a levelheaded way.\nFollow @CNNOpinion\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.\nOpinions\nI was the unpopular kid.
