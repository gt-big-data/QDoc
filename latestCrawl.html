           Why has the Guardian launched a new direction for its climate campaign?
           <br/>
          </p>
         </h2>
         <p>
          In December, leaders and negotiators from more than 190 countries meet in Paris to negotiate a crucial new deal on climate change. There has arguably never been a more important time for the media to take a stand on the issue.
         </p>
         <p>
          As the Paris summit approaches,
          <a class=" u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/keep-it-in-the-ground">
           Keep it in the ground
          </a>
          , the Guardian’s climate campaign that launched in March, is making a shift in direction to tap into a rare commodity in the climate debate - hope. In particular, we are aiming to give a fresh focus on the solar revolution already underway and transforming the global energy system. We want to show that the transition to a world run on clean energy is possible and indeed already happening outside the doors of the UN. We also want to give a platform to the people impacted by the decisions being made in Paris and to showcase the energy and creative actions that our readers can get involved in.
          <a class=" u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/05/a-story-of-hope-the-guardian-launches-phase-two-of-its-climate-change-campaign">
           Read more about our new focus in our launch piece here.
          </a>
         </p>
         <h2>
          Why are you focusing on hope? Aren’t you underestimating the challenge of climate change a bit?
         </h2>
         <p>
          The supporters of Keep it in the ground have been its backbone so when it came to deciding where to turn next, we looked at what they had told us. One message came through loud and clear: people want hope.
         </p>
         <p>
          There’s no doubting that the challenges posed by climate change are monumental, but we believe that the potential of clean energy and the stories of people finding new ways to fight climate change are currently underreported. As the first phase of Keep it in the ground focused on this challenge and the threat of the fossil fuel industry, we now want to make a point of surfacing a positive narrative. We hope it will show that many of the tools needed for the transition to a world run on clean energy are already available, although they may require significantly quicker investment. If the campaign first asked about divestment, it’s now time to turn the tables and ask: what about investment? What do we need to do and what is already happening to create a better world?
          <br/>
         </p>
         <h2>
          Why are you focusing on solar so much? What about other renewables?
         </h2>
         <p>
          Tackling climate change will take a variety of approaches and we plan to tell many different solutions stories. But we want to showcase in particular the potential of the solar revolution that is currently underway. Since 2009, the price of solar panels has dropped by around 70%, meaning that in some developing countries, where many inspiring projects are in progress, it is as cheap or cheaper than fossil fuels.
         </p>
         <p>
          Hillary Clinton has made it a significant part of bid to be the next president, with the industry now the fastest growing source of power in the US and year-on-year residential rooftop installations in the country increasing by 70%.

          It shone the spotlight on the investments of the world’s biggest charitable foundations and funders of medical research – the Bill and Melinda Gates’ Foundation and the Wellcome Trust – asking them to move the money out of the oil, coal and gas companies polluting the planet. At the same time, we invested in journalism to tell the story of the fossil fuel industry, including

          We aren’t giving up on the movement at all – it’s the fastest growing divestment campaign of all time and we still want to be a part of it. We will continue to give a voice to the global movement and to push the Wellcome Trust and Gates’ Foundation to divest. Our original decision to support divestment was inspired by 350.org and the work of campaigners around the world, so we will continue to work with them to support the movement.

          Within a few weeks of launching, the Guardian Media Group, which owns the Guardian,
          <a class=" u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/01/guardian-media-group-to-divest-its-800m-fund-from-fossil-fuels">
           committed to divest its £800m fund from fossil fuels
          </a>
          , becoming the largest fund in the world to do so, at the time.
         </p>
         <p>
          Over the duration of the campaign, many other institutions have made the same decision.
          <a class=" u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/22/leonardo-dicaprio-joins-26tn-fossil-fuel-divestment-movement">
           A recent report
          </a>
          showed that the worth of institutions divesting so far is $2.6tn, a 50-fold increase in the past year. Notable commitments since March have come from the largest pensions funds in the US, the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world and major universities including California, Oxford and Syracuse.
         </p>
         <p>
          Of course, we don’t know what role the campaign played in these decisions, but it is worth noting that since launching Bill Gates has
          <a class=" u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/26/gates-to-invest-2bn-in-breakthrough-renewable-energy-projects">
           committed to invest $2bn (£1.3bn)

          <a class=" u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2015/WTP059795.htm">
           launched a new £75m programme
          </a>
          to investigate the links between the environment and health.
         </p>
         <p>
          We hope that the campaign has shifted the focus of the climate change debate on to health, economics and politics, with increasing coverage of divestment in many other media outlets. In May, the Climate Publishers’ Network was launched, a partnership and agreement between leading news organisations to share climate change content in the approach to Paris.

          its investments are not simply there to make money: “when instructing the investment managers, Bill and Melinda also consider other issues beyond corporate profits, including the values that drive the foundation’s work. They have defined areas in which the endowment will not invest, such as companies whose profit model is centrally tied to corporate activity that they find egregious. This is why the endowment does not invest in tobacco stocks.”

In 2013 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had invested at least $1bn of this in 35 of the top 200 carbon reserve companies, while in 2014 the Wellcome Trust had £564m invested in Shell, BP, Schlumberger, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton alone.

          that proven fossil fuel reserves are more than three times higher than we can afford to burn in order to stay below the generally agreed threshold for dangerous climate change. Fossil fuel companies are currently banking on extracting these reserves and selling them – and are actively prospecting for more. By supporting these companies, investors not only continue to fund unsustainable business models that are bound to make climate change worse, but they also risk their financial assets becoming worthless if international agreements on climate change are met.

          Isn’t it hypocritical for the Guardian to take advertising from fossil fuel companies?

         <p>
          The Guardian believes that editorial independence is essential. We have a strict policy of not allowing advertisers to influence editorial content. Furthermore, one can argue that historically, it was funding from advertising that enabled editorial independence. The noted historian of British newspapers, Francis Williams, described in his 1958 book, Dangerous Estate, how the daily press “would never have come into existence as a force in public and social life if it had not been for the need of men of commerce to advertise. Only through the growth of advertising did the press achieve independence.” Before advertising, newspapers were often funded directly by political parties with inevitable consequences.

          The risk posed by today’s fossil fuel industry to the climate comes down to simple arithmetic using just three numbers, or
          <a class=" u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719?page=2">

          </a>
         </p>
         <p>
          The first number is 2C, the amount of global warming the world’s governments have set as a limit. Beyond 2C, the world’s scientists project
          <a class=" u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/02/rapid-carbon-emission-cuts-severe-impact-climate-change-ipcc-report">
           “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” on people
          </a>
          . The 2C number began life in 1995 as a round number that was useful in political negotiations. But since then scientists have warned that even 2C of warming will bring damaging impacts.
         </p>
         <p>
          The second number is 565bn tonnes (gigatons or GT) of carbon dioxide, which scientists estimate is the maximum amount that can be produced by future fossil fuel burning if we are to have an 80% chance of keeping global warming under 2C.
          <a class=" u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://carbontracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Carbon-budget-checklist-FINAL-1.pdf">
           If you use a lower chance, say 50% or 66%
          </a>
          , the amount of allowable CO2 gets a bit bigger.
         </p>
         <p>
          But whatever the amount, they are all dwarfed by the third number. This is the total CO2 that would be released if today’s proven reserves of coal, oil and gas are burned: 2,795 GT. That is the fossil fuel identified and ready to extract.
         </p>
         <p>
          So here’s the arithmetic. To stay under 2C, only 565 GT of CO2 can be emitted, but there is already 2,795 GT - fives times more - ready to burn.

          </strong>
         </h2>
         <p>
          The carbon budget is the amount of greenhouse gas that can still be released into the atmosphere without exceeding dangerous levels of climate change - the 2C target agreed by international governments. In 2013, the
          <a class=" u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ipcc.ch/">

           carbon budget
          </a>
          for the first time, announcing that the world burns through about 50bn tonnes of greenhouse gases every year. It is also very likely that more than 20% of emitted CO2 will remain in the atmosphere longer than 1,000 years after manmade emissions have stopped. This means that if we continue to emit at current levels, we will “spend” the carbon budget within 15 to 25 years. Given that we have already used two-thirds of the budget, the IPCC have urged governments to act quickly, using the carbon budget as the basis for international negotiations.

           report on fossil fuel divestment
          </a>
          published by the University of Oxford in October 2013. It said: “stigmatisation poses the most far-reaching threat to fossil fuel companies and the vast energy value chain. In every case we reviewed, divestment campaigns were successful in lobbying for restrictive legislation.”

          Won’t divestment from fossil fuels result in the end of modern civilisation?
         </h2>
         <p>
          It is true that most of today’s energy, and many useful things such as plastics and fertilisers, come from fossil fuels. But the divestment campaign is not arguing for an end of all fossil fuel use starting tomorrow, with everyone heading back to caves to light a campfire. Instead it is arguing that the burning of fossil fuels at increasing rates is driving global warming, which is the actual threat to modern civilisation. Despite already having at least three times more proven reserves than the world’s governments agree can be safely burned,
          <a class=" u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD/PROD0000000000349119.pdf#page=21">
           fossil fuel companies are spending huge sums
          </a>
          exploring for more. Looked at in that way, pulling investments from companies committed to throwing more fuel on the climate change fire makes sense.

          Isn’t divestment hypocritical because we all use fossil fuels?

         <p>
          Again, no-one is arguing for an overnight end to all fossil fuel use. Instead, the

          </a>
          group which is leading the divestment campaign calls for investors to commit to selling off their coal, oil and gas investments over five years. Fossil fuel burning will continue after that too, but the point is to reverse today’s upward trend of ever more carbon emissions into a downward trend of ever less carbon emissions. Furthermore, some of those backing a “divest-invest” strategy move money into the clean energy and energy efficiency sectors which have already begun driving the transition to a low-carbon world.

          Isn’t this just gesture politics rather than meaningful action?
         </h2>
         <p>
          The dumping of a few fossil few stocks makes no immediate difference at all to the amount of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere. But this entirely misses the point of divestment, which aims to remove the legitimacy of a fossil fuel industry whose current business model will lead to
          <a class=" u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/02/rapid-carbon-emission-cuts-severe-impact-climate-change-ipcc-report">

          impacts on people. Divestment works by stigmatising, as pointed out in a
          <a class=" u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/research-programmes/stranded-assets/SAP-divestment-report-final.pdf">
           report from Oxford University:
          </a>
          “The outcome of the stigmatisation process poses the most far-reaching threat to fossil fuel companies. Any direct impacts pale in comparison.”
         </p>
         <p>
          The “gesture politics” criticism also ignores the political power of the fossil fuel industry, which
          <a class=" u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://burningquestion.info/">
           spent over $400m on lobbying and political donations in 2012 in the US alone
          </a>
          . Undercutting that lobbying makes it easier for politicians to take action and the Oxford study showed that previous divestment campaigns – against apartheid South Africa, tobacco and Darfur – were all followed by restrictive new laws.
         </p>
         <p>
          Those comparisons also highlight the moral dimension at the heart of the divestment campaign. Another dimension is warning investors that their fossil fuel assets may lose their value if climate change is tackled. Lastly, backing divestment does not mean giving up putting direct pressure on politicians to act or any other climate change campaign.

         <p>
          They may do but the stocks being divested are too small to flood the market and cut share prices, so they won’t be going cheap. Those who do purchase these stocks are prioritising short-term financial gain over long-term investment. As the president of the World Bank has said, an investment portfolio that recognises the financial risk of climate change is “acting in simple self-interest”. More to the point, the strategy of the divestment movement is not to bankrupt the fossil fuel industry by the removal of shares but to cause reputational damage.

            Science is science, and there is no doubt that if we burned all the fossil fuel that’s in the ground right now that the planet’s going to get too hot and the consequences could be dire… We’re not going to be able to burn it all.

            Climate change is the challenge of our time. Each of us must recognise that the risks are personal. We’ve seen and felt the costs of underestimating the financial bubble. Let’s not ignore the climate bubble.
