                      a 2005 address to the PEN World Voices Festival in the United States,
                     </a>
                     Alexievich explained how she found her writing style. Her comments were translated into English.
                    </p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">
                     For people living in Slavic countries, the spoken word is extremely important, she said. "The point is not simply to exchange facts and information -- the idea is that it's important to speak of the essence of life and of its mystery."
                    </p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">
                     "As I was searching for the way to represent this, I began to understand that what I was hearing people say on the street and in the crowds was much more effectively capturing what was going on than what I was reading in print -- and the way that people were trying to convey it using their pen," Alexievich said.
                    </p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">
                     In the modern world, she said, it was impossible to write "the book" that encompassed everything in the manner of 19th century novelists.
                    </p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">
                     "We need to have a book where lots of people can make a contribution -- one person may speak half a page, someone else may have a paragraph or five pages that they can contribute and that this is a way of conveying what's going on today."
                    </p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">
                     "And my genre, I refer to it as 'the novel of voices' and you might say that my work as just simply lying on the ground and I go and I gather it and I pick it up and I put it together. If Flaubert said 'I am a man of the pen -- or the plume,' I could say of myself that I am a person of the ear."
                    </p>

                     Alexievich is not the first historian to win the prize, the most prestigious literature award in the world. Winston Churchill won  in 1953, primarily for his sweeping, multivolume works documenting British history and the two world wars.
                    </p>
                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">
                     Alexievich's books include "The Chernobyl Prayer," "The War's Unwomanly Face," "Last Witness," and "Zinky Boys."

                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">
                     Her family later moved to Belarus, where both her parents worked as teachers.

                    <p class="zn-body__paragraph">
                     She began her career as a reporter on a local newspaper before formally studying journalism at Minsk University. She then worked as both a teacher and journalist, eventually taking the position of correspondent for a literary magazine.

                     She tried various literary genres, but attributes her final choice to Belarusian writer Ales Adamovich, who her website says "helped her find a path of her own."

                     Alexievich's first book, "I've Left My Village," gave her a reputation as a dissident. When she completed "The Unwomanly Face of the War," in 1983, she was accused of the "de-glorification of the heroic Soviet woman." The work was not published until 1985, when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power.
