        At the foot of Second Street in Brooklyn, hard by the Gowanus Canal, is a tiny green space with a very big job.

        Aptly called Sponge Park, the 2,100-square-foot plot will, when it opens next spring, intercept thousands of gallons of storm water, along with pollutants like heavy metals and dog waste, before they can enter the canal. The park’s absorbent qualities come from flood-tolerant plantings like asters, Rosa rugosa and sedge grass, as well as a network of sand beds and soils designed to hold water.

        The park is part of a larger effort in New York City and urban areas across the country to prevent polluted storm water from flowing directly into rivers or overloading sewage treatment plants. With combined storm-sewer systems like New York’s, in which one set of pipes handles both sewage and storm water, even moderate rainfall can overwhelm treatment plants, causing raw sewage to spew into waterways.

        The issue has added urgency along the heavily polluted Gowanus Canal, which was

        </a>
        . Not only does the 1.8-mile canal have a series of so-called outflow pipes — discharge points that divert the mix of sewage and storm water from overtaxing the local treatment plant in rainy weather — but there are also a dozen street ends abutting the Gowanus where storm water cascades unimpeded into the canal.

       <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="212" data-total-count="1934" itemprop="articleBody">
        Sponge Park is a $1.5 million pilot project, overseen by the city’s Department of Environmental Protection, that will determine whether such spaces can effectively prevent new pollution from entering the canal.

        Ms. Drake said an analysis by her firm showed that in the vast majority of storms, the park would capture all of the water flowing to the lower stretch of Second Street, with a dead end at the canal. During the heaviest rainfall, the park will at least cleanse and filter water before it flows into the canal. Rainwater itself is fairly clean, but it

        Ms. Drake has a patent pending on the specific design of the park, which features alternating beds of gravel and plantings. And she has trademarked the name Sponge Park, in the hope that it can be replicated elsewhere.

        Each year across the city, nearly 30 billion gallons of raw sewage and polluted storm water are discharged from hundreds of pipes into local waterways when sewage plants are overwhelmed. Such overflows can occur up to 75 times a year, according to the environmental group the

        In addition to using traditional, so-called gray infrastructure like holding tanks and tunnels, the program deploys green roofs, gardens, special soils and porous surfaces to capture and retain storm-water runoff — often through landscapes such as curbside gardens and playgrounds.

        It is an approach gaining momentum across the United States, where 860 municipalities have combined sewer systems, according to Adrian Benepe, the senior vice president and director of city park development at the

        In New York City, the trust has overseen the construction of seven playgrounds designed to capture storm water, out of 40 that are planned, and it will develop nearly 40 playgrounds in Philadelphia. The group is also involved in several other green infrastructure projects, from Los Angeles to Boston.

        But the Gowanus Canal, a murky, narrow waterway that suffered decades of industrial abuse, has a separate set of challenges. Along the entire length of the canal, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has discovered contamination including

        Still, Ms. Drake said a goal of Sponge Park was to prevent the addition of new pollution into the canal as various agencies embarked on the cleanup. It will use precast, modular components that can be quickly assembled.
